## Was GA everything I expected a coding bootcamp to be?
Yes, absolutely! It was as intense as I anticipated, however just as rewsrding as I had hoped. I got very lucky to have an *AMAZING* instructor the whole way through who made the lectures interactive, easy to stay attentive in and, very importantly - fun! I was fully excited for every single one of his lectures, regardless if it's the first one in the morning or closer to 5pm at night! Thank you @dvlpr_dan for making this challenging time so much fun!

## How many hours did I work daily/weekly?
On average I probably spent about 10-12 hours in front of my computer on weekdays and 5-6 hours om the weekends! Rounding down that comes to an average of 70 hours per week of coding, reading, studying or sitting in lectures. This is definitely a little more than was necessary to pass the bootcamp - I always did my very best to complete every bonus assignment, challenge or just some codewars/hacker rank/leetcode algorithm exercises in addition to the bare minimum requirements. 

## More questions will be added at a later time!
